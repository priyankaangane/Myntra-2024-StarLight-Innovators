### Overview
With the increasing demand for online shopping and the need for personalized user experiences, Myntra aims to leverage advanced technologies to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. This project focuses on identifying current fashion trends through social media analysis, creating 3D visualizations of trending products, and developing a virtual try-on feature using augmented reality (AR) to provide a seamless and interactive shopping experience.

### Objectives
1. **Identify current fashion trends** using social media interactions (likes & comments).
2. **Implement 3D visualization** to showcase trending products dynamically.
3. **Develop a virtual try-on feature** to enhance customer experience.

### Focus Areas
1. **Trend Identification:** Utilizing data analytics and market research to identify emerging fashion trends.
2. **Engagement on a Shopping Platform:** Building engagement constructs on the platform to drive connection and virality among younger audiences, encouraging habitual visits to the app.

### Procedure
#### Data Collection
**Instagram Scraper:**

We utilized Instaloader to gather relevant metadata and images from Instagram, focusing on posts by influential users and utilizing engagement metrics (likes & comments) for trend analysis.

1. **Data Collection with Instaloader:** Efficient extraction of metadata including profile names and timestamps.
2. **Metadata Collection:** Detailed logging of profile names and timestamps for trend analysis.
3. **Image Download:** Automated download of images based on timestamps to maintain relevance.

#### Trend Analysis
**Timeline: 9/07/24 - 11/07/24**

Using collected metadata, we analyzed engagement metrics (likes & comments) to identify trending fashion items on Instagram.

#### 3D Modeling
**Timeline: 12/07/24 - 14/07/24**

Automated 3D modeling attempts using PiFuHD were unsuccessful, so we opted for manual creation of 3D models to meet project deadlines.

#### Virtual Try-On
**Timeline: 13/07/24 - 15/07/24**

We successfully implemented a virtual try-on feature using AR lenses, refining our approach based on user feedback for optimal usability.

### Results
#### Trend Identification:
Successful identification of trending fashion items based on social media engagement metrics.

#### 3D Modeling:
Accurate manual creation of 3D models for showcased products.

#### Virtual Try-On:
Positive user feedback on the AR-based virtual try-on feature.

### Android Application
An Android application was developed to present trending products and facilitate user interaction seamlessly.

#### Features:
1. **Data Gathering:** Extraction of trend data from Instagram.
2. **Product Analysis:** Identification and display of trending items.
3. **Storage and Presentation:** Integration with Excel for data management and user-friendly product display.

#### Implementation:
1. **Data Collection:** Automated retrieval of Instagram data via Instaloader.
2. **AR Implementation:** Integration of AR capabilities for virtual try-on.
3. **UI/UX Design:** Creation of an intuitive interface for optimal user experience.
